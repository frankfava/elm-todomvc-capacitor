# TodoMVC in Elm, with Ionic Capacitor!

This repo is a minimal port of the classic [evancz/elm-todomvc](https://github.com/evancz/elm-todomvc) application, with the additional infrastructure necessary to run as a native, cross-platform mobile application powered by [Ionic Capacitor](https://capacitorjs.com/docs/).

**All of the application code is in Elm!** To get started quickly, simply fork this repo, then scroll on down to the [Caveats](#caveats) section for a brief overview of what you'll need to change in order to build a native mobile application with Elm + Ionic Capacitor.

But wait - there's more! This repo serves as a tutorial. I've tried to build the different layers of this application as a set of pull requests that are all linked in this document. The comments on the pull request show which changes were made, when, and why - and you can read an overview for each major changeset here in this readme, as well.

If you have questions, feel free to shoot me a DM in [Elm Slack](https://elmlang.slack.com/), or ping me on Twitter [@lambdapriest](https://twitter.com/lambdapriest).
